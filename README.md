# Hugging Face Image Generation with Gradio

This project allows users to generate images from text prompts using the Hugging Face API for the model `sd-community/sdxl-flash`. The app uses Gradio to provide an interactive web interface where users can input text prompts, and it will return generated images.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to interact with Hugging Face's inference API to generate images based on user input. The image generation is powered by the `sd-community/sdxl-flash` model, and Gradio is used to build a simple web interface.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.7+
- An active Hugging Face account
- An internet connection to access the Hugging Face API

Steps to Get Hugging Face Token
Go to the Hugging Face website.
Sign in or create a new account.
Once logged in, navigate to your Hugging Face Account Settings.
Under "Access Tokens," click on "New token."
Give your token a name (e.g., Image-Generation-Token), select the required permissions (usually "Read" permissions will be sufficient), and click "Generate."
Copy the generated token.
Using Your Token
To authenticate requests to the Hugging Face API, you need to add your token to the code. Replace the "" in the following line with your Hugging Face token:

python
Copy code
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN"}
How to Run the Project
After setting up the project and obtaining your Hugging Face token, run the following command to start the Gradio interface:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will launch a local Gradio interface that will allow you to input text prompts and view the generated images.
A shareable link will be provided in the terminal, which you can use to access the app from any browser.
