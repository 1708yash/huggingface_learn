AI Image Generation with Hugging Face & Gradio
This project demonstrates how to use Hugging Face and Gradio to create a simple web application for generating images using pre-trained models. It leverages the Hugging Face API to interact with a model and Gradio for building an intuitive user interface to generate images from text prompts.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, you need to have:

Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
An active Hugging Face account for API access.
Git installed (optional, if you are cloning the repo).
Virtual environment setup for dependency management.
How to Install and Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install the Required Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt does not exist, you can manually install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install gradio requests pillow
4. Get Your Hugging Face API Token
To use the Hugging Face API, you need an API token. Follow these steps to get your token:

Go to Hugging Face.
Create an account (if you don’t have one) and log in.
Navigate to Settings → Access Tokens.
Click New Token to generate an API token.
Copy the generated token.
5. Set Up the API Token in Your Project
Once you have your API token, set it in the project to authenticate with Hugging Face’s model API:

Open the app.py file in your project folder.
Find the line with the header headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}.
Replace "YOUR_TOKEN" with the token you copied from Hugging Face.
Example:

python
Copy code
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer 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"}
6. Run the Application
Now, you’re ready to run the project! Use the following command to launch the Gradio interface:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Gradio interface, and you should see the local URL in the terminal. Open the URL in your browser to access the image generation application.

Example:

csharp
Copy code
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
How It Works
This project uses Hugging Face’s SDXL model to generate images from text prompts. When you input a text prompt, the following steps happen:

The text prompt is sent via an API request to the Hugging Face model.
The model generates an image based on the prompt and sends it back.
The image is then displayed in the Gradio interface.
Customizing the Model and Application
To use a different Hugging Face model, change the API_URL in the app.py file to the URL of your chosen model from Hugging Face.
You can also modify the Gradio interface to accept other types of input or customize the UI according to your needs.
